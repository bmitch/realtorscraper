## Steps to setup the scraper

### Obtain the CURL request
* Use Chrome Browser and open dev tools to the network tab.
* Conduct your search on the Realtor site.
* Filter requests called `PropertySearch_Post`.
* Right click this request and choose `Copy as CURL`.

### Parse the CURL request
* Open Postman (https://www.getpostman.com).
* Import -> Paste RAW Text.
* Paste the text in the text area and click 'Import'.
* Copy the URL used in the request and save it in the .env file with the key `REALTOR_URL`.
* Copy the raw body in the request and save it in the .env file with the key `REALTOR_SEARCH_<name for search>`.
* Set the domain of the Realtor site to the .env value `REALTOR_DOMAIN`

### Setup email
* In the .env file:
 * `REALTOR_EMAIL_FROM` is who the email will be sent from.
 * `REALTOR_EMAIL_TO` is who the email will be sent to. This can be a single address or multiple addresses separated by a comma. Example: 'one@email.com,two@email.com'.

 ### Run the command
 We'll use the example that you saved your search with a env variable name of `REALTOR_SEARCH_HOUSES`, to run this search:
 `php artisan realtor:scrape houses`
